<h4>&ldquo;Wyll and Testament&rdquo;</h4>
<p>By Isabella Whitney<br />
The time is come I must departe<br />
from thee, ah, famous Citie:<br />
I never yet, to rue my smart,<br />
did finde that thou hadst pitie,<br />
Wherefore small cause ther is, that I<br />
should greeve from thee to go:<br />
But many Women foolyshly,<br />
lyke me, and other moe.Doe such a fyxed fancy set,<br />
on those which least desarve,<br />
That long it is ere wit we get,<br />
away from them to swarve,<br />
But tyme with pittie oft wyl tel<br />
to those that wil her try:<br />
Whether it best be more to mell,<br />
or vtterly defye.<br />
And now hath time me put in mind,<br />
of thy great cruelnes:<br />
That never once a help wold finde,<br />
to ease me in distres.<br />
Thou never yet woldst credit geve<br />
to boord me for a yeare:<br />
Nor with Apparell me releve<br />
except thou payed weare.<br />
No, no, thou never didst me good,<br />
nor ever wilt, I know:<br />
Yet am I in no angry moode,<br />
but wyll, or ere I goe,<br />
In perfect love and charytie<br />
my Testament here write:<br />
And leave to thee such Treasurye,as I in it recyte.<br />
Now stand a side and geve me leave<br />
to write my latest Wyll:<br />
And see that none you do deceave,<br />
of that I leave them tyl.<br />
I whole in body, and in minde,<br />
but very weake in Purse:<br />
Doo make, and write my Testament<br />
for feare it wyll be wurse.<br />
And fyrst I wholy doo commend,<br />
my Soule and Body eke:<br />
To God the Father and the Son,<br />
so long as I can speake.<br />
And after speach: my Soule to hym,<br />
and Body to the Grave:<br />
Tyll time that all shall rise agayne,<br />
their Judgement for to have.<br />
And then I hope they both shal meete.<br />
to dwell for aye in ioye:<br />
Whereas I trust to see my Friends<br />
releast, from all annoy.<br />
Thus have you heard touching my soule,and body what I meane:<br />
I trust you all wyll witnes beare,<br />
I have a stedfast brayne.<br />
And now let mee dispose such things,<br />
as I shal leave behinde:<br />
That those which shall receave the same,<br />
may know my wylling minde.<br />
I firste of all to London leave<br />
because I there was bred:<br />
Braue buildyngs rare, of Churches store,<br />
and Pauls to the head.<br />
Betweene the same: fayre streats there bee,<br />
and people goodly store:<br />
Because their keeping craveth cost,<br />
I yet wil leave him more.<br />
First for their foode, I Butchers leave,<br />
that every day shall kyll:<br />
By Thames you shal have Brewers store,<br />
and Bakers at your wyll.<br />
And such as orders doo obserue,<br />
and eat fish thrice a weeke:<br />
I leave two Streets, full fraught therwith,they neede not farre to seeke.<br />
Watlyng Streete, and Canwyck streete,<br />
I full of Wollen leave:<br />
And Linnen store in Friday streete,<br />
if they mee not deceave.<br />
And those which are of callyng such,<br />
that costlier they require:<br />
I Mercers leave, with silke so rich,<br />
as any would desyre.<br />
In <mark className='cheapeside-market'><u>Cheape</u></mark> of them, they store shal finde<br />
and likewise in that streete:<br />
I Goldsmithes leave, with Iuels such,<br />
as are for Ladies meete.<br />
And Plate to furnysh Cubbards with,<br />
full braue there shall you finde:<br />
With Purle of Siluer and of Golde,<br />
to satisfye your minde.<br />
With Hoods, Bungraces, Hats or Caps,<br />
such store are in that streete:<br />
As if on ton side you should misse<br />
the tother serues you feete.<br />
For Nets of every kynd of sort,<br />
I leave within the pawne:French Ruffes, high Purles, Gorgets and Sleeves<br />
of any kind of Lawne.<br />
For Purse or Kniues, for Combe or Glasse,<br />
or any needeful knacke<br />
I by the Stoks have left a Boy,<br />
wil aske you what you lack.I Hose doo leave in <mark className='birchin-lane'><u>Birchin Lane</u></mark>,<br />
of any kynd of syse:<br />
For Women stitchte, for men both Trunks<br />
and those of Gascoyne gise.<br />
Bootes, Shoes or Pantables good store,<br />
Saint Martins hath for you:<br />
In Cornwall, there I leave you Beds,<br />
and all that longs thereto.<br />
For Women shall you Taylors have,<br />
by Bow, the chiefest dwel:<br />
In every Lane you some shall finde,<br />
can doo indifferent well.<br />
And for the men, few Streetes or Lanes,<br />
but Bodymakers bee:<br />
And such as make the sweeping Cloakes,<br />
with Gardes beneth the Knee.<br />
Artyllery at <mark className='temple-bar'><u>Temple Bar</u></mark>,and Dagges at Tower hyll:<br />
Swords and Bucklers of the best,<br />
are nye the <mark className='fleete-street'><u>Fleete</u></mark> vntyll.<br />
Now when thy Folke are fed and clad<br />
with such as I have namde:<br />
For daynty mouthes, and stomacks weake<br />
some Iunckets must be framde.<br />
Wherfore I Poticaries leave,<br />
with Banquets in their Shop:<br />
Phisicians also for the sicke,<br />
Diseases for to stop.<br />
Some Roysters styll, must bide in thee,<br />
and such as cut it out:<br />
That with the guiltlesse quarel wyl,<br />
to let their blood about.<br />
For them I cunning Surgions leave,<br />
some Playsters to apply.<br />
That Ruffians may not styll be hangde,<br />
nor quiet persons dye.<br />
For Salt, Otemeale, Candles, Sope,<br />
or what you els doo want:<br />
In many places, Shops are full,<br />
I left you nothing scant.<br />
Yf they that keepe what I you leave,<br />
aske Mony: when they sell it:<br />
At Mint, there is such store, it is<br />
vnpossible to tell it.<br />
At Stiliarde store of Wines there bee,<br />
your dulled mindes to glad:<br />
And handsome men, that must not wed<br />
except they leave their trade.<br />
They oft shal seeke for proper Gyrles,<br />
and some perhaps shall fynde:<br />
(That neede compels, or lucre lures<br />
to satisfye their mind.)<br />
And neare the same, I houses leave,<br />
for people to repayre:<br />
To bathe themselues, so to preuent<br />
infection of the ayre.<br />
On Saturdayes I wish that those,<br />
which all the weeke doo drug:<br />
Shall thyther trudge, to trim them vp<br />
on Sondayes to looke smug.<br />
Yf any other thing be lackt<br />
in thee, I wysh them looke:<br />
For there it is: I little broughtbut nothyng from thee tooke.<br />
Now for the people in thee left,<br />
I have done as I may:<br />
And that the poore, when I am gone,<br />
have cause for me to pray.<br />
I wyll to prisons portions leave,<br />
what though but very small:<br />
Yet that they may remember me,<br />
occasion be it shall:<br />
And fyrst the Counter they shal have,<br />
least they should go to wrack:<br />
Some Coggers, and some honest men,<br />
that Sergantes draw a back.<br />
And such as Friends wyl not them bayle,<br />
whose coyne is very thin:<br />
For them I leave a certayne hole,<br />
and little ease within.<br />
The Newgate once a Monthe shal have<br />
a sessions for his share:<br />
Least being heapt, Infection might<br />
procure a further care.<br />
And at those sessions some shal skape,<br />
with burning nere the Thumb:And afterward to beg their fees,<br />
tyll they have got the some.<br />
And such whose deedes deserueth death,<br />
and twelue have found the same:<br />
They shall be drawne vp Holborne hill,<br />
to come to further shame:<br />
Well, yet to such I leave a Nag<br />
shal soone their sorowes cease:<br />
For he shal either breake their necks<br />
or gallop from the preace.<br />
The <mark className="fleete-prison"><u>Fleete</u></mark>, not in their circuit is,<br />
yet if I geve him nought:<br />
It might procure his curse, ere I<br />
unto the ground be brought.<br />
Wherfore I leave some Papist olde<br />
to vnder prop his roofe:<br />
And to the poore within the same,<br />
a Boxe for their behoofe.<br />
What makes you standers by to smile.<br />
and laugh so in your sleeve:<br />
I thinke it is, because that I<br />
to Ludgate nothing geve.<br />
I am not now in case to lye,here is no place of iest:<br />
I dyd reserve, that for my selfe,<br />
yf I my health possest.<br />
And ever came in credit so<br />
a debtor for to bee.<br />
When dayes of paiment did approch,<br />
I thither ment to flee.<br />
To shroude my selfe amongst the rest,<br />
that chuse to dye in debt:<br />
Rather then any Creditor,<br />
should money from them get.<br />
Yet cause I feele my selfe so weake<br />
that none mee credit dare:<br />
I heere reuoke: and doo it leave,<br />
some Banckrupts to his share.<br />
To all the Bookebinders by Paulles<br />
because I lyke their Arte:<br />
They e'ry weeke shal mony have,<br />
when they from Bookes departe.<br />
Amongst them all, my Printer must,<br />
have somwhat to his share:<br />
I wyll my Friends these Bookes to bye<br />
of him, with other ware.For Maydens poore, I Widdoers ritch,<br />
do leave, that oft shall dote:<br />
And by that meanes shal mary them,<br />
to set the Girles aflote.<br />
And wealthy Widdowes wil I leave,<br />
to help yong Gentylmen:<br />
Which when you have, in any case<br />
be courteous to them then:<br />
And see their Plate and Iewells eake<br />
may not be mard with rust.<br />
Nor let their Bags too long be full,<br />
for feare that they doo burst.<br />
To e'ry Gate vnder the walles,<br />
that compas thee about:<br />
I Fruit wives leave to entertayne<br />
such as come in and out.<br />
To Smithfeelde I must something leave<br />
my Parents there did dwell:<br />
So carelesse for to be of it,<br />
none wolde accompt it well.<br />
Wherfore it thrice a weeke shall have,<br />
of Horse and neat good store,<br />
And in his Spitle, blynd and lame,to dwell for evermore.<br />
And Bedlem must not be forgot,<br />
for that was oft my walke:<br />
I people there too many leave,<br />
that out of tune doo talke.<br />
At Bridewel there shal Bedelles be,<br />
and Matrones that shal styll<br />
See Chalke wel chopt, and spinning plyde,<br />
and turning of the Mill.<br />
For such as cannot quiet bee,<br />
but striue for House or Land:<br />
At Th' innes of Court, I Lawyers leave<br />
to take their cause in hand.<br />
And also leave I at ech Inne<br />
of Court, or Chauncerye:<br />
Of Gentylmen, a youthfull roote,<br />
full of Actiuytie:<br />
For whom I store of Bookes have left,<br />
at each Bookebinders stall:<br />
And parte of all that London hath<br />
to furnish them withall.<br />
And when they are with study cloyd:<br />
to recreate theyr minde:Of Tennis Courts, of dauncing Scooles,<br />
and fence they store shal finde.<br />
And every Sonday at the least,<br />
I leave to make them sport.<br />
In diuers places Players, that<br />
of wonders shall reporte.<br />
Now London have I (for thy sake)<br />
within thee, and without:<br />
As coms into my memory,<br />
dispearsed round about<br />
Such needfull thinges, as they should have<br />
heere left now unto thee:<br />
When I am gon, with consience,<br />
let them dispearced bee.<br />
And though I nothing named have,<br />
to bury mee withall:<br />
Consider that aboue the ground,<br />
annoyance bee I shall.<br />
And let me have a shrowding Sheete<br />
to couer mee from shame:<br />
And in obliuyon bury mee<br />
and never more mee name.<br />
Ringings nor other Ceremonies,vse you not for cost:<br />
Nor at my buriall, make no feast,<br />
your mony were but lost.<br />
Reioyce in God that I am gon,<br />
out of this vale so vile.<br />
And that of ech thing, left such store,<br />
as may your wants exile.<br />
I make thee sole executor, because<br />
I lou'de thee best.<br />
And thee I put in trust, to geve<br />
the goodes unto the rest.<br />
Because thou shalt a helper neede,<br />
In this so great a chardge,<br />
I wysh good Fortune, be thy guide, least<br />
thou shouldst run at lardge.<br />
The happy dayes and quiet times,<br />
they both her Seruants bee.<br />
Which well wyll serue to fetch and bring,<br />
such things as neede to thee.<br />
Wherfore (good London) not refuse,<br />
for helper her to take:<br />
Thus being weake and wery bothan end heere wyll I make.<br />
To all that aske what end I made,<br />
and how I went away:<br />
Thou answer maist like those which heere,<br />
no longer tary may.<br />
And unto all that wysh mee well,<br />
or rue that I am gon:<br />
Doo me comend, and bid them cease<br />
my absence for to mone.<br />
And tell them further, if they wolde,<br />
my presence styll have had:<br />
They should have sought to mend my luck;<br />
which ever was too bad.<br />
So fare thou well a thousand times,<br />
God sheelde thee from thy foe:<br />
And styll make thee victorious,<br />
of those that seeke thy woe.<br />
And (though I am perswade) that I<br />
shall never more thee see:<br />
Yet to the last, I shal not cease<br />
to wish much good to thee.<br />
This, xx. of October I,<br />
in ANNO DOMINI:A Thousand: v. hundred seuenty three<br />
as Alminacks descry.<br />
Did write this Wyll with mine owne hand<br />
and it to London gaue:<br />
In witnes of the standers by,<br />
whose names yf you wyll have.<br />
Paper, Pen and Standish were:<br />
at that same present by:<br />
With Time, who promised to reveale,<br />
so fast as she could hye<br />
The same: least of my nearer kyn,<br />
for any thing should vary:<br />
So finally I make an end<br />
no longer can I tary.</p>
